# The Bread Path — Whitepaper for $BUT

## 🍞 The Origin

In a time of pump & dumps, when wallets ran dry and memes lost meaning...  
A new token rose from the crumbs of the fallen — **BUT**.

> One $BUT = One Loaf.  
> The bread you *can* count on.

## 🔥 The Mission

To bring back meaning to memecoins.  
To feed the soul, and sometimes, maybe, even the stomach.

## 📈 Utility? You Bet.

- Store of value (when carbs pump).  
- Medium of meme.  
- Hedge against hunger.

## 🥖 Tokenomics

- Supply: Deliciously scarce  
- Distribution: 100% organic  
- Governance: No forks. Only loaves.

## 🔗 Join the Movement

Because in the end, **we're all just trying to put bread on the table.**
